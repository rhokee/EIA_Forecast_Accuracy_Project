Starting in 1979, the EIA published an Annual Energy Outlook report in which they forecast energy production for most major energy resources. During the 2023-2024 academic year, several faculty and students across the St. Lawrence Environmental Science and MSCS Departments, including myself, came together to conduct research on the accuracy of these forecasts. This project was guided by the following questions: Does the EIA NEMS model make accurate forecasts? Has the NEMS model improved in accuracy over time? Does the size of the resource influence accuracy? Which resources are predicted with the most/least accuracy? And finally, is there any difference in prediction accuracy for production, consumption, and renewable energy generation?

My role in the project was to create an interactive Shiny App website that analyzes and visualizes the forecast data. This site builds multiple plots, according to certain criteria that are determined by a userâ€™s inputs, that help visualize forecast accuracy over time for different resources.

The code for the Shiny App is contained within the file "app.R", and the data used in this project is contained within the file "energy_forecast_data.csv".
